              Hi! Iâ€™m Dara Sobaloju, the Founder of This Tech Thing

              I am a Senior Product Designer with experience designing products
              across fintech,logistics,insurance and web3. Over time, I've
              received numerous DMs from young designer on Twitter and LinkedIn,
              asking me to mentor them. As much as i wanted to help, I realized
              that I couldn't mentor everyone on an individual basis.
            </p>

            <p className="font-neue font-normal text-base  md:text-xl text-[#f9f9f9]  leading-[1.5] ">
              Out of my desire to help young designers, I started This Tech
              Thing by sending out Google forms on twitter, looking for mentors
              and mentees who could be matched based on their skilss and
              experiences.
            </p>

            <p className="font-neue font-normal text-base  md:text-xl text-[#f9f9f9]  leading-[1.5] ">
              The response to the first cohort was overwhelming. I'm proud of
              the impact that This Tech Thing have had on the careers of the
              participants, with many of them reporting increased income and job
              opportunities.
            </p>

            <p className="font-neue font-normal text-base  md:text-xl text-[#f9f9f9]  leading-[1.5] ">
              I believe that mentorship is crucial and I'm committed to
              providing a platform for designers to learn, grow and advance
              their careers in the tech industry.
